# Asteroid Lightcurve

The goal of this toy project is to measure the lightcurve of an
asteroid based on real 42-inch imaging data. The following steps will
be covered:

1. image calibration (bias-subtraction and flatfield correction)
2. asteroid identification
3. aperture photometry
4. determination of the rotational period
