Your Talk Title Goes Here
=========================

*Given by Horton who Heard a Who at Whoville on YYYY MM DD.*

Here's a nice place to put in a general description of what you talked about
and why.  Keep it brief!  Not looking for a dissertation here, just a
description of what is actually in this folder.  Also a good place to mention
anything you forgot or want to specifically highlight.

NOTE: I've found it handy to keep the last two sections ("Get Python" and
"Additional Links..." in each one as a reference for newcomers.

## Example Files
* [README File](README.md)

## Jupyter Notebooks
* [Introduction to matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot](../04_PlottingWithPython/01_Intro.ipynb)

## Get Python
[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

## Additional Links for More Detailed Overviews
Additional materials that should be reviewed for the basics like
datatypes and all that kind of stuff:

[Introduction to Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-workshops/tree/master/aas231_workshop)

[Introduction to Python for Scientists](https://github.com/mommermi/Introduction-to-Python-for-Scientists)
