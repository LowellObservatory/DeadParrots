Python Code
-----------
ard_serial.py - Simple serial communications interface to the Arduino,
	      	designed to fulfill much the same roll as the Serial
	      	Monitor Tool provided by the Arduino IDE. This include
	      	higher level commands that are roof control specific
	      	in addition to the generic methods to handle the
	      	connection and communications. Written assuming
	      	Python3, but might work under Python2.

ard_tks.py - A Python3/Tk based GUI that wraps the ard_serial.py
	        functionality. Written assuming Python3, but also
	        might work under Python2.

sel_tks.py - Lower level GUI, logging and string manipulation
	        functions used by ard_serial and ard_tks.

Arduino Code
------------
roof_control.ino - Software for the Arduino. Compile and load it using
                   the standard Arduino development environment
                   which can be found at
                   https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Once the roof_control code has been uploaded to your Arduino, and all
three python files are in your current directory, you should be able
to run the GUI to talk with the Arduino. This has been tested under
Linux and MacOSX. The parts under the sel_tks.py have also been tested
under Windows.

This can be run directly from the command line:
  csh> python3 ./ars_tks.py
or
  csh> ./ars_tks.py

or from within python
  >>> import ars_tks as art
will load and start up the GUI.


I have tried to keep the external package dependencies limited.  Here
is a list of the packages (or parts of packages) that this software
imports at one time or another:

from time       import gmtime, strftime, sleep
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
import glob
import io
import os
import serial
import serial.tools.list_ports as stl
import sys
import threading
import tkinter as tk
