More Astropy: units, tables, coordinates, some more FITS
========================================================

*Given by Michael Mommert at Lowell Observatory on 2018 09 14.*

We will talk about using astropy functionality to handle data (astropy.table),
proper handling of units (astropy.units), dealing with sky coordinates
(astropy.coordinates), and a convenient way to display, scale, and stretch FITS
files (astropy.visualization).

## Example Files
* [Basics of Units and Image Scales](dead_parrot.py)

## Get Python
[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

datatypes and all that kind of stuff:
