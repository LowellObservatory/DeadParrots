Plotting with Python
====================

*Given by Ryan T. Hamilton at Lowell Observatory on 2018 08 24.*

I went through the three Jupyter notebooks given below.  I spent a lot of time on #1, a bit of time on #2, and hardly any time on #3.

## Jupyter Notebooks
* [Introduction to matplotlib and matplotlib.pyplot](01_Intro.ipynb)
* [Plotting and Dealing with Images](02_ImagesOverlays.ipynb)
* [Other Plotting Packages Out There](03_AllTheRest.ipynb)

## Get Python
[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
