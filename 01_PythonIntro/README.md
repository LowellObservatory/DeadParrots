Python: For Fun and Professional Profit
=======================================

*Given by Ryan T. Hamilton at Lowell Observatory on 2018 07 26.*

In the presentation, I stopped at slide 28 and brought up the 
three included code examples; this was the order in which we talked 
about them, from simple to more complex:

1) [FITSfilefactory.py](FITSfilefactory.py)
2) [devices.py](devices.py)
3) [Lissajooser.py](Lissajooser.py)

Note that the PDF version of the presentation I gave won't have the
animated GIFs in it, but the PPTX one does.

## Get Python
[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

## Integrated Development Environments
The ones I specifically mentioned today are 

* [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)

Note that both of these are installable via Anaconda.

datatypes and all that kind of stuff:
