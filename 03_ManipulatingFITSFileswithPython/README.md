Manipulating FITS files with Python 
===================================

*Given by Dyer Lytle at Lowell Observatory on 2018 08 17.*

I (Ryan) wasn't around for this one, but Dyer presented things via Jupyter notebooks.  Those can be found here:

## Jupyter Notebooks
* [Simple FITS file manipulation in Python with astropy.io.fits](jupyter/Basic_Fits.ipynb)
* [Fitting a Moffat function to a series of FITS images from a focus sweep](jupyter/Focus-Sweep-Fit.ipynb)
* [Image stacking, summing, median](jupyter/Image-Stacking.ipynb)


## Get Python
[Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
